NO2 acts mainly as an irritant affecting the mucosa of the eyes, nose, throat and respiratory tract.
Low level NO2 exposure may cause: increased bronchial reactivity in some asthmatics, decreased lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and increased risk of respiratory infections, especially in young children.
Extremely high-dose exposure (as in a building fire) to NO2 may result in pulmonary edema and diffuse lung injury.
Continued exposure to high NO2 levels can contribute to the development of acute or chronic bronchitis.

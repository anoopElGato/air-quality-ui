Properly ventilate areas where ethanol-containing products are used, such as bathrooms with cleaning agents or kitchens with alcoholic beverages.
Store ethanol-containing products in well-ventilated areas and tightly sealed containers to minimize vapor emissions.
Avoid excessive use of ethanol-based cleaning agents or solvents in enclosed spaces, and follow manufacturer instructions for proper use and ventilation.
Be mindful of using ethanol-based products in areas where ignition sources are present, as ethanol vapor can be flammable at certain concentrations.
Dispose of ethanol-containing products properly and according to local regulations to prevent environmental contamination and accidental exposure.
